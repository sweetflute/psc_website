      <h4>Co-Designing Interactive Technology with International Students</h4>
      <p>This project examines what kinds of challenges international students’ have and how technology can better support them when settling down in the U.S. Particularly, we aim to encourage international students to have better experience while settling down well in the U.S. as well as to be equal participants in the University communities. Having co-designing workshops with participatory approach, we plan to develop the prototype into the actual system and to provide it to the new international students with the collaboration of FIUTS.</p>

      <h4>Better Planning for Social Activities</h4>
      <p>Many people plan to participate in various social activities, but fail to make it.
      In this project, we are exploring the underlying mechanism of how individuals’ behavioral intention changes as time goes by while examining Theory of Planned Behavior in the consideration of time frame. We aim to shape tailored design strategies to support various stakeholders of social activities.</p>

      <h4>Taming lifelogs</h4>
      <p>In this project, we examine self-trackers' goals and how technology can better support them. Thus far, we have designed cuts — a subset of collected data with some shared feature — and corresponding visualizations. Combinations of cuts and visualizations offer more actionable feedback than many curent lifelog visualizations, but more work is needed to determine which cuts make sense for which goals, users, and contexts, and how and when to best present them.</p>

      <p>We are building and deploying a series of social software applications designed to support various aspects of wellness. This will help us learn more about best practices for adding social dimensions to these applications. This project is funded by Intel, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School.</p>

      <h4>Tailoring user interface displays with social comparison strategies</h4>
      <p>This project's goal is to understand how social comparison theory can
      assist adapting systems to different user scenarios. People approach
      information and perform differently when using online systems.
      Tailoring people's experiences might prove beneficial for increasing
      their performance and engagement.</p>

      <h4>Mining Cognitive Structures from Social Networks for Automated Creation of Tailored Motivational Campaigns</h4>
      <p>We extract topics of interest from online communities to automatically create tailored health behaviour change campaigns based on multiple diverse motivational messages. The advantages of having diverse motivational messages in a campaign are clear – higher compliance and better recall. On the other hand, multiple motivational messages that are too similar may lead to annoyance, boredom, and decreased compliance. Current practices of introducing diversity to messages rely on handcrafted formulation by experts of each single motivational message. This is costly, time-consuming, and lacks flexibility in changing real-life conditions. We investigate the use of models of cognitive structures, models able to map relations among motivational concepts for a selected user group, to help automatically generate more effective, diverse, and tailored motivational messages in a cost effective and flexible manner.</p>
